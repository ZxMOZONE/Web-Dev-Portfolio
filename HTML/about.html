        <h3>Key Achievements and Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed coverage matrix across multiple subsystems, achieving a
            thorough understanding of the SoC and ensuring 0 bug escapes on
            owned IPs. Defined and refined over 80 test cases, meeting customer
            needs and delivering the product within the agreed timeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verified IP designs from RTL code and reduced pre-silicon validation
            effort by 50% by addressing bugs in simulation before FPGA testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Led verification of Low Power/Peripheral Subsystems (WDT, SPI, I3C,
            GPIO, PWM) in the RISC-V project, achieving 100% coverage in WDT,
            SPI, GPIO and PWM protocols and 90% in I3C, which are all based on
            Synopsys controller, exceeding OKRs by 20%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Played a key role in the Power On phase, verified initial chip
            functionality and conducted full electrical testing on the
            customer-provided board. 30% of the overall test execution was
            completed within 1 week of Power On, exceeding the overall
            verification progress across the team of 4 engineers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contributed to PCIe verification on RISC-V project and led PCIe
            verification on the ARM project, resolving signal integrity issues
            in two weeks and achieving 100% protocol coverage across multiple
            layers: Phy, DLLP and TLP.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provided technical support and expertise to colleagues across
            various verification tasks globally, increasing the team efficiency
